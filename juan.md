## Linear Regression

Linear regression is arguably the simplest ML algorithm. The basic idea is to find a relationship between 1 numeric feature and another numeric feature. where the machineâ€™s task is to identify values of a and b such that the determined line is best able to relate the supplied values of x values to the values of y.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

## Decision Tree and Random Forest

Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, A decision tree begins with a root node, the first decision point for splitting the dataset, and contains a single feature that best splits the data into their respective classes. Random forest is an extension of Decision Trees.
